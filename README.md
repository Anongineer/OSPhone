My current idea is a system based around the freescale imx6quad, that SoC has everything and it is very open. 
2d/3d graphics acceleration, sata, gigabit LAN, chip level encryption, tamper security, LVDS, MIPI DSI, CSI camera interface and much more. 
The gsm modules power and mic connections can be controlled by the processor, allowing full control and fredom over your device. 
It would be the size of an UMPC while still allowing you full freedom and even stuff like sms and call encryption. 
If enough people are into the idea we could might even get it kickstartet. 
I hope the EE's of the internet are interested since this would grant us full control over our personal data.
